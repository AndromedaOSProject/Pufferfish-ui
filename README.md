# Pufferfish
A modern UI manager (Desktop Environment, Compositor, Shell, Window Manager, System UI) for AndromedaOS
## Overview
Pufferfish is a modern shell that runs on fullscreen Wayland with a Flutter-based UI stack for the upcoming AndromedaOS mobile OS. It displays System UI components (Status bar, shade, launcher, power options, gestures, overview, ect), displays both Andromeda Apps (WIP) using a framebuffer powered system (both on Shell and App, WIP) to inter process and display input and output from and to the shell and app, respond to key presses (volume up, power button, combinations), IPC with Andromeda Apps with APIs and in the future, support for other toolkits (GTK, Qt, Waydroid, games, although implementation is required on the app side) and native arm64 on Arch (base of AndromedaOS) are both planned
## Current Status
For now, the project is very prototype (Pre-Alpha), thus there isn't any availably published code. Expect the alpha version to come in a few weeks, but as usual, expect many missing features and bugs
